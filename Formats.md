5) any other option involving code

## Format 2: Workshop

- Kotlin in Android
- _anything regarding Kotlin_


## Format 3: Panel/Open discussion, questions & answers (Q&A) or fishbowl conversations

- Do you have any Kotlin related question you do not know how to address?
- Would you like to propose a discussion about an available recorded talk in a previous conference or about some specific chapters or pages of a Kotlin book?

While we were recieving them we'll make them publicly in the following meetup and will keep some time to discuss them.

## Format 4: Talk

1. Some examples of a talk might be:

- Introduction to Kotlin
- Coroutines

2. The following are the types of talk duration to fit in:

- Mini talk: 5 up to 15 minutes
- Small talk: 15 up to 25 minutes
- Medium talk: 25 up to 35 minutes
- Long talk: 35 up to 50 minutes

Mini and small talks are your option if:

At the end of each talk 5-10 minutes for questions if any are kept.
